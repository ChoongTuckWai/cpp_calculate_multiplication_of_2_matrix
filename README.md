## DONE

1. To avoid pollute source tree, an out-of-source build code style is recommended. "cmake" is a popular build code tool that is capable of fitting aforementioned requirements. Please involve this tool to your project.

2. Put your implements in .c or .cpp file and build a corresponding dynamic library (.so) to separate your job from main system.

3. Use float or double type instead of int in this project.

5. measure execution time of function

## TODO

4. For UI behavior, use a default value to simplify testing procedure. Keep dynamic input matrix dimension in advanced mode.
